My name is Anthony Beger. I am 18 years old and I am from White Hall, AR. I am currently working on getting my B.S. in Data Science from the University of Arkansas and I am set to graduate in spring 2024. I am very interested in sports, especially football, basketball, and soccer, and in my free time I love watching sports, going outdoors, and listening to music. Data Science is interesting to me, because I love problem solving and getting to work with data to make exciting discoveries and innovations. I would love to get to become a data analyst for a professional sports team in the future.
