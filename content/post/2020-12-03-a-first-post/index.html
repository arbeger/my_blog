<h1>NFL Attendance</h1>
<p>For this project, I will be examining the NFL attendance data from the <code>attendance.csv</code> file on the Tidy
Tuesday Website. The data consists of 10,846 observations and 8 variables. The dataset shows the the total
attendance and weekly attendance for every NFL team dating back to the 2000 NFL season.</p>
<p>Another dataset that I will be using to explore NFL attendence is the <code>standings.csv</code> file from the Tidy
Tuesday website. The data consists of 638 observations and 15 variables. Some of the variables in this
dataset show how well each NFL team preformed in each season since 2000, these variables include the
number of <code>wins</code> and <code>losses</code> as well as whether each team made the <code>playoffs</code> or won the Superbowl in the
<code>sb_winner</code> variable. This dataset also represents how good each team preformed on offense and defense
by having <code>points_for</code> and <code>points_against</code> variables as well as <code>offense_ranking</code> and <code>defense_ranking</code>.
This data will help me see if there is a correlation between team success and attendance.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will be using the <code>games.csv</code> file from the Tidy Tuesday website. The data consists of 5,324
observations and 19 variables. The data shows the outcomes of every NFL game dating back to the 2000
NFL season. The <code>home_team</code> , <code>away_team</code>, and <code>winner</code> variables will be useful to see if there is any sort
of home field advantage in the NFL. The <code>day</code>, <code>date</code>, and <code>time</code> variables will be useful to see if NFL games
played on different times and dates have different amounts of attendance.</p>

<div id="question-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Question 1</h1>
<p>Do playoff teams have more attendance at their home games than non-playoff teams? If so,
does the Superbowl winner usually lead the league in attendance? To test this, I first joined the attendance
dataset and the standings dataset to compare the attendance data and whether or not each team
made the playoffs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- attendance %&gt;%
  left_join(standings, by = c(&quot;team&quot;, &quot;team_name&quot;, &quot;year&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Next, I made some graphics to better visualize if there was any correlation between higher home field attendance and team success. The first graphic I made plots the total attendance at home games for that season against the number wins that team had and whether or not they made the playoffs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(dat, aes(x = wins, y = home)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = playoffs)) +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Wins&quot;, y = &quot;Total Attendence at Home Games&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Home Game Attendence vs Wins and Playoff Births&quot;) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c(&quot;#999999&quot;, &quot;#E69F00&quot;)) +
  theme_economist() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.35)) </code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Next, I wanted to easily compare the difference in total attendance at home games between teams that made the playoffs and those that did not and between teams that won the Superbowl and those that did not. Therefore, I made 2 boxplots, one that plots total home team attendance against whether each team made the playoffs, and another that plots total home team attendance against whether each team won the Superbowl.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p1 &lt;- ggplot(dat, aes(x = playoffs, y = home)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = &quot;Playoff Birth&quot;, y = &quot;Total Attendence at Home Games&quot;) +
  theme_economist() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.35))

p2 &lt;- ggplot(dat, aes(x = sb_winner, y = home)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = &quot;Superbowl Winner&quot;, y = &quot;Total Attendence at Home Games&quot;) +
  theme_economist() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.35))

patchwork &lt;- p1 + p2
patchwork + 
  plot_annotation(title = &quot;Home Game Attendence vs Playoff Births &amp; Superbowl Winners&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to see which teams had the highest average home attendance since 2000 and whether the teams with the highest attendance where the most successful. To test this, I made a a bar graph that plots the average home attendance since 2000 for each NFL team, and I ordered the teams on the x-axis by the number of playoff appearances that they had since 2000 to see if there was any trend.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat2 &lt;- dat %&gt;%
  group_by(team_name) %&gt;%
  summarize(avr_home = mean(home))

dat3 &lt;- standings %&gt;%
  count(playoffs, team_name) %&gt;%
  filter(playoffs == &quot;Playoffs&quot;) %&gt;%
  left_join(dat2, by = &quot;team_name&quot;)

ggplot(dat3, aes(x = reorder(team_name, -n), y = avr_home)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = &quot;Teams ordered by Number of Playoff Appearances since 2000&quot;, y = &quot;Home Attendences&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Average Home Attendence since 2000 by NFL Team&quot;) +
  theme_economist() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.35))</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />
There is a clear positive correlation between teams that went to the playoffs and higher attendance at home games. However, there were many teams with high attendance that missed the playoffs and teams with low attendance that did make the playoffs. Also, when looking at Superbowl Winners, there is almost no difference in attendance between teams that did win the Superbowl and those who did not. Lastly, the average home attendance graph shows that there is no correlation between teams with high average attendance and more playoff appearances. This leads me to believe that the effect that high attendance has on the success of NFL teams is very small.</p>

<h1>Question 2</h1>
<p>Is there any home field advantage in the NFL? To test this, I</p>
<pre class="r"><code>games %&gt;%

<p>So far this is as far as I have gotten, bc there are way more times than I thought and I am still trying to figure out a way to deal with it.</p>

<div id="question-3" class="section level1">
<h1>Question 3</h1>
<p>Do teams with a good offense attract more attendence? If not, good defense, or does it not matter? To test this, I will join the attendance dataset and the standings dataset to be able to compare attendance data with offensive and defensive data for each team.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- attendance %&gt;%

<p>The graphs show that both a good offense and defense attract slightly larger crowds to NFL games.</p>
