<h1>European Energy Usage: Clean Energy vs.Â Conventional</h1>
<p>Using data that is available on the Tidy Tuesday website on European Energy, I will investigate the energy usage among European countries with an emphasis on which countries are the best at using renewable energy. I will be examining data from the <code>energy_types.csv</code> file from the Tidy Tuesday website. The data consists of 296 observations and 7 variables. The data displays each the energy production from each European country from 2016-2018 and breaks it down by how much energy was produced by conventional thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, pumped hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal, and other.</p>
<p>The second dataset I will use to explore European Energy production is the <code>country_totals.csv</code> file from the Tidy Tuesday website. The data consists of 185 observations and 7 variables. The data displays the total energy consumption of each European country from
2016-2018 as well as the total energy production of each country.</p>

<div id="question-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Question 1</h1>
<p>Which European country had the largest percentage of their total energy production made up of renewable energy in 2018? Which European country had the largest percentage of their total energy production made up of clean energy? To find this, I joined the energy types and country totals datasets. I will also mutate the dataset to combine all of types of energy production that are renewable.</p>
