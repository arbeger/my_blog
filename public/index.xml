      <description>European Energy Usage: Clean Energy vs.Â Conventional Using data that is available on the Tidy Tuesday website on European Energy, I will investigate the energy usage among European countries with an emphasis on which countries are the best at using renewable energy. I will be examining data from the energy_types.csv file from the Tidy Tuesday website. The data consists of 296 observations and 7 variables. The data displays the energy production from each European country from 2016-2018 and breaks it down by how much energy was produced by conventional thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, pumped hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal, and other.</description>

      <description>My name is Anthony Beger. I am 18 years old and I am from White Hall, AR. I am currently working on getting my B.S. in Data Science from the University of Arkansas and I am set to graduate in spring 2024. I am very interested in sports, especially football, basketball, and soccer, and in my free time I love watching sports, going outdoors, and listening to music. Data Science is interesting to me, because I love problem solving and getting to work with data to make exciting discoveries and innovations.</description>
