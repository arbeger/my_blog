      <description>European Energy Usage: Clean Energy vs.Â Conventional Using data that is available on the Tidy Tuesday website on European Energy, I will investigate the energy usage among European countries with an emphasis on which countries are the best at using renewable energy and clean energy. I will be examining data from the energy_types.csv file from the Tidy Tuesday website. The data consists of 296 observations and 7 variables. The data displays the energy production from each European country from 2016-2018 and breaks it down by how much energy was produced by conventional thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, pumped hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal, and other.</description>
